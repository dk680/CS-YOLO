## Introduction

The CervHernia-YOLO model builds upon YOLOv10 by integrating several advanced techniques to enhance segmentation accuracy for small, complex targets in MRI images. This model focuses on cervical spine pathology segmentation and includes the following components:

- **YOLOv10**: Serves as the foundational model, known for efficient object detection performance. [YOLOv10 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14458)
- **EfficientNetV2**: Optimized network architecture, providing high computational efficiency. [EfficientNetV2 Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00298)
- **Inner-ShapeIoU**: Improved IoU metric for robust shape-based segmentation. [ShapeIoU Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17663),[InnerIoU Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02877)
- **SDI (Shape Deformation-Integrated)**: Allows flexible shape deformation, improving performance in complex segmentation tasks. [SDI Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.17791v1)
- **Dynamic Snake Convolution**: Enhanced boundary detection for precise segmentation of complex shapes. [Dynamic Snake Convolution Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.08388)

Each of these advancements contributes to CS-YOLOâ€™s strong performance on benchmark datasets, making it a valuable tool for cervical spine MRI segmentation.
